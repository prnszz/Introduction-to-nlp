# Just a notebook
It's December 12, 2023, now. I am attending a Japanese class in Tohoku university. 
I am a second-year student in the Faculty of Education at Tohoku and dream of joining the Tohoku NLP Group.
Although I am not a computer science major, I am eager to study NLP.
I want to record and share my progress:)
